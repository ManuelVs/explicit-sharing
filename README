Explicit Sharing of Monadic Effects
===================================

This package implements a monad transformer for sharing monadic
effects.

This package is available on Hackage:

  http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/explicit-sharing

It can be installed using cabal install:

  cabal install explicit-sharing

This repository also contains benchmark programs: 'permsort', 'naive
reverse' and 'logic last' -- all for Haskell and Curry.
 
Instructions on how to compile the benchmarks can be found in the
corresponding source files.
 
Regression tests can be found in Test.hs and run using 'cabal test'.
