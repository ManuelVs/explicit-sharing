Explicit Sharing of Monadic Effects
===================================

This package implements a monad transformer for sharing monadic
effects of monads for non-determinism.

This package is available on Hackage:

  http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/explicit-sharing

This repository also contains three benchmark programs: permsort,
naive reverse, and a functional-logic last function -- all for Haskell
and Curry.

Instructions on how to compile the benchmarks can be found in the
corresponding source files.

Regression tests can be found in Test.hs and run using 'cabal test'.
