% explicit-sharing

This [Haskell] package implements explicit sharing of monadic
effects. Its most prominent application is probably the implementation
of lazy non-determinism to emulate functional-logic programming.


install
-------

You can obtain the package from [Hackage]. If you have [cabal-install]
you can simply type

    cabal install explicit-sharing

to install it.

-----

The [tutorial] introduction explains how to use the interface of the
library for explicit sharing.


contribute
----------

The packages source code is on [GitHub] so you can create or vote on
[issues] to ask for extensions or fork this project to write
extensions yourself. I will happily merge your improvements and
publish them as part of this package.
